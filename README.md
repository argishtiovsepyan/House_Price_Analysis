# Evaluating the Impact of Optional ACT and SAT Tests on Student Participation and Performance

As a data scientist hired by the reality TV show House Hunters, my task is to create a predictive model that accurately estimates housing prices in Ames, Iowa. The show's producers want me to provide a reliable tool for couples on the show to help them make informed decisions while searching for their dream home in Ames.

For this project, I will analyze the extensive Ames Housing Dataset, which includes a wide range of features associated with residential properties in Ames. My objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sale prices of houses based on these features. This will assist the House Hunters participants in understanding the fair market value of the properties they encounter during their search.

# Executive Summary

This project aims to evaluate the impact of making ACT and SAT tests optional on student participation rates and scores. With many colleges making these tests optional in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it provides a unique opportunity to assess whether the requirement of these tests influences student participation and if voluntary participation leads to improved scores.

The methodology involves a comparative analysis of data from 2017, 2018, and 2019 versus 2021, with particular emphasis on changes in participation rates and scores. Data sources include ACT and SAT test participation rates and scores, and information on college test requirements. The analysis will employ statistical testing and visualizations to discern any significant trends.

The key findings and insights from this project will help determine the ongoing value of investing in these tests and offer a more nuanced understanding of student motivation and performance in the context of standardized testing. This will, in turn, provide a basis for informed recommendations to the U.S. Department of Education about the future of ACT and SAT requirements.

The conclusions drawn from the findings will enable the U.S. Department of Education to make informed decisions about resource allocation and policy changes related to standardized testing. Future steps could include investigating other aspects of learning such as mindfulness practice for mental health and financial literacy that could be prioritized and exploring the impact of such changes on college admission outcomes.
